				?Glory to thee, Motherland,
				O Motherland of mine.
				Sweet i thy beauty,
				Sweet is thy fragrance,
				Around thee we gather
				As one people,
				As one nation,
				In peace, justice and liberty.
				Beloved country, may God bless thee
				For ever and ever.

			<h1>SCHOOL PRAYER</h1>
			<h3>
				Lord
				Make me an instrument of thy peace
				Where there is hatred;
				Let me sow love;
				Where there is injury, pardon;
				Where there is doubt, faith;
				Where there is despair, hope;
				Where there is darkness, light;
				And where there is sadness, joy;

				O Divine Master,
				Grant that I may not so much seek,
				To be consoled as to console;
				To be understood as to understand;
				To be loved as to love;
				For it is in giving that we receive;
				It is in pardoning that we are pardoned
				And it is in dying that we are born to eternal life.
				So help me God.
