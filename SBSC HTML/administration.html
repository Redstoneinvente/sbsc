			<h2>Rector's Message</h2>
			<h3>
				"It gives me much pleasure to welcome you to the electronic portal of Sookdeo Bissoondoyal State College and to write about the seriousness of purpose of the school administration and the expectations of the students I care for. At the very outset, I commend the living spirit with which my students express their enthusiasm to be at school on each day. The young learners cherish the dream to roar like the mighty dragons which they have rightly chosen as their spirit animal to inspire them into the meanders of their pathway. True as the mighty ‘dragons’ they pool their pride and show their determination to win over their challenges. I understand that their world can be daunting as they try to make sense of their reality amidst a changing world. I, however, reassure them that they are well cared for by their teachers who spare no effort to make their learning journey a meaningful one.
				The challenge is essentially one to keep students engaged in academia so that their schooling experience is relevant to their needs. At SBSC, we delve into a holistic pattern of education where at each step, students are amazed at the opportunities that their school has to offer. This website has been designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of our commitment to this school. We present to you the work of a dedicated team who has set the tone for achieving excellence in its noble intention. We also demonstrate factually the results achieved by our students in their quest for knowledge and developmental skills. Our aim remains to marvel our students’ young minds with the ‘new’ by welcoming them into the paradigm of 21st-century education skills.
				The flagship programmes harnessed at Sookdeo Bissoondoyal State College have been purposely crafted to broaden the vision of our students while making them more humane at the plea of those struggling in society. The tone is thus set to make our students resilient in the face of life’s troubles and make them responsive to those in need: the essential qualities indeed to foster in the minds and hearts of our children to make them true patriots.
				I, therefore, welcome you to discover our school website and we hope to convince you that our community of practitioners are indeed delivering value education to our children as we prepare them for their global journey as world citizens."
